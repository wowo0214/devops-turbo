# docs

This is a Next.js application generated with
[Create Fumadocs](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs).

Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## AI chat and site configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
`OPENROUTER_MODEL` selects the model explicitly; the chat endpoint requires both
values and does not select a paid model when configuration is missing.
The example uses `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free`.

Set `SITE_URL` to the site's actual URL in production so social preview images
resolve against the correct origin. Restart the development server after editing
environment variables. Keep `.env.local` out of Git.

From the monorepo root, run `pnpm exec turbo run docs#dev` for development,
`pnpm exec turbo run docs#check-types` for type checking, and
`pnpm exec turbo run docs#build` for a production build.
